# Product Overview

## Fresta - Advent Calendar Platform

Fresta is a Brazilian advent calendar platform that allows users to create interactive countdown experiences with themed content. The platform serves multiple personas through distinct product areas:

### Core Product Areas

**B2C (Consumer)** - Individual creators who build personal advent calendars for events like Christmas, New Year, birthdays, relationships, and other celebrations. Users can create calendars with daily "doors" containing text, photos, GIFs, or links.

**B2B (Business)** - Companies and content creators who need branded advent calendar campaigns for marketing, onboarding, community engagement, and promotional activities.

**Admin** - Internal management console for platform oversight, theme catalog management, user analytics, and subscription management.

### Key Features

- **Themed Calendars**: Pre-designed themes for holidays (Christmas, Carnival, São João) and life events (weddings, relationships, birthdays)
- **Interactive Doors**: Daily content reveals with countdown mechanics
- **Privacy Controls**: Public calendars with shareable links or private calendars
- **Offline-First**: Currently operates with localStorage persistence (migration to Supabase planned)
- **Multi-Platform**: Responsive design optimized for mobile app experience and desktop application interface

### Current Status

The project is intentionally built as a **100% frontend MVP** using localStorage for data persistence. This allows for rapid prototyping and feature development before backend integration. The codebase includes comprehensive migration plans for eventual Supabase integration.

### Brazilian Market Focus

The platform is designed specifically for the Brazilian market with Portuguese language, local holidays (Carnaval, São João, Independence Day), and cultural themes that resonate with Brazilian users.
